# What is Qiskit? :
  Qiskit is open-source software for working with quantum computers at the level of circuits, pulses, and algorithms. Additionally, several domain specific application API’s exist on top of this core module.

  The central goal of Qiskit is to build a software stack that makes it easy for anyone to use quantum computers, regardless of their skill level or area of interest; Qiskit allows one to easily design experiments and applications and run them on real quantum computers and/or classical simulators. Qiskit is already in use around the world by beginners, hobbyists, educators, researchers, and commercial companies.

# Tasks Given :
Writing based -
1. If you enjoy writing, you could:
2. Write a blog post explaining what you’ve learnt and how the experience was.
Use this blog to document your journey, through quantum computing or any
other areas of interest.
3. Write a blog post explaining the Hardy paradox to a specific target audience, e.g.
“someone who hates maths”, or “someone who loves puzzles”.
4. Tackle an open issue on the Qiskit Textbook GitHub repo, or suggest a change
for something you think could be improved.
5. Investigate a proposed application of quantum computing. What kind of
advantages can we expect? And what performance will we need from a quantum
computer to be able to reach this advantage? Be careful of bold claims and
pseudoscience. Write up your results as a blog post.
